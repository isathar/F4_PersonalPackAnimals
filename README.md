# Personal Pack Animals

A WIP Fallout 4 Mod. Adds an alternate follower system for pack animals.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installation

- Download from the releases tab or bethesda.net, extract the esp and ba2 files to Fallout4\\Data\\
- Activate PersonalPackAnimals.esp using your preferred method.


## Usage

- Build an Animal Trainer structure in one of your settlements. It can be found in the workshop menu under Resources -> Misc.
	- A holotape with somewhat finished instructions will be added to your inventory once it's built.
	- This structure contains several 'crafting' recipes to create packs for your captured animals, convert animals to live in a settlement, and 'order' new animals to be captured.
- A half-finished buggy way to assign settlers as guards is included, and can be accessed by building a Guard Center and assigning settlers to it.
- Pack animals can be captured by using Beta Wave Grenades and Mines, which can be crafted at Chemistry Stations or Animal Trainers.
	- Each animal type has a different chance of being captured by grenades and mines.
	- Values still need some tweaking - it may take a lot of grenades to capture some animals.
- Pack animals can be ordered around like any other followers, and include a dialogue menu with several options and commands that can be accessed by using 'Talk' in the main dialogue menu.
- After building a pack, you can upgrade it at an Armor Workbench to add tracking capabilities and extra pack capacity. Bigger packs will slow animals down.


## Warnings

- This is a work in progress - It mostly works, but definitely needs some more work. 
- Some features are poorly or not at all documented.
- The scripts need an optimization pass or two - lots of debug functions that need to be cleaned up.
 can bloat your save files.
- The pack meshes aren't especially optimized.


## Known Issues / ToDo list

- The following animals' packs are invisible for now:
	- Deathclaw, Mirelurk, Gorilla, Yao Guai, Cat, Radroach
	- Their stat increases still work, but no meshes are inclued for them yet.
- Molerat packs and Brahmin bandanas have clipping issues with some animations.
- Remote Commands don't work yet.
- Lots of debug text is still visible.
- There is currently no limit to the number of idle pack animals. Don't overdo it. Your save file will thank you for it.
- Track all Idle/Active is not currently enabled. You will need to equip your pack animals with either an implant or an RF Emitter pack upgrade.
- The Animal Trainer and Animal Guard Center structures are slightly retextured copies of the Caravan Center for now. They will be replaced with custom meshes in a future release.
- Radstags have a tendency to sit down and slide across the ground instead of walking.
- Radstag and Dog heavy pack addons are identical visually to light ones.
- Pack lamps don't work yet. They can be attached to brahmin packs, but will not light up.
- Several people have reported their pack animals disappearing when waiting or being sent to a settlement.
- Pack inventory will sometimes (rarely) disappear. Don't store things you're attached to in animal packs for now.
- Sending a pack animal from Far Harbor to a Commonwealth settlement can cause it to disappear.
